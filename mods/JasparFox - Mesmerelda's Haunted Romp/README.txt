"So, you just so happened to wander into my crypt, eh? Typical mortal of you... acting so blissfully ignorant... Normally, I'd have devoured your soul from the moment you saw me, but I'm feeling a little generous today. It's been a while since I've sated my... lets say, 'carnal urges', so I'll give you a chance to leave with your body and soul as healthy as it was when it stepped into my lair. If you're too weak to handle my skills, I'll take your soul just as easily as I take your seed, and add you to the mountain of lifeless husks in my servitude... But if you can last until I've had all the fun I need, I'll let you walk free, and we can forget about your little 'accident'... Now lie down and prepare yourself for me, I don't have all day~"
