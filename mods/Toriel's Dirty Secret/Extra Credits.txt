Aside from KomDog's art, there are some modders who I want to give credit to. However, since so many mod assets have been recycled across however many mods, it's difficult to pin down the original creators. So I'd like to list their work that I used and thank them.
-Toriel animations for fellatio
-Toriel animations for from behind sex

This mod is heavily inspired by a previous mod "Asriel and Toriel's Dirty Secret" by Penguinologist.
I just swapped out animations that I pulled together or edited for "Toriel's Heartache" and wrote a new chart using the same song.

I did some minor audio tweaks to some existing sfx. "slap-double" is a new one that I edited together to be used with with a certain paizuri animation.
Additional tweaks were made to include different eye positions and blushing for animations in the intro.
