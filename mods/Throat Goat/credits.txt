Original Mod and art by J.J.#2174 on discord.

The goat's adorable expression and overall head is NOT MADE BY ME so please support the artists I shamelessly copied stuff from at:

The character is a small appearance in the game Inscryption, the same game this mod's visual style takes inspiration from.
