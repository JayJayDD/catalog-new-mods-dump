in order to chang the animations first find or make a gif and go to 
https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite
once you modify the gif so there are only 6 frames you then go to make the sprite sheet.
on that site make shore that columns are set to 3
width is set to 600
height is set to 800
margin around tiles is set to 1px

Then all you do is name it the same name as one of the existing pngs to replace that part with the animations that you want.
